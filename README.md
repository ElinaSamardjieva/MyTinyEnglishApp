The concept of the app is to help the user with studying English in his own personal way and using the full potential of everything around him. 


The user will have different options to study. The aplication will have three categories:
1. Vocalization side. It is friendly named **Recording studio** - in this part of the application the user will be able to type a word that he wants and to listen the pronounciation and getting familiar with it. The best part is that after hearing the pronounciation he will be able to record his own voice saying the word and after that listnening the recording and comparing it with the original application's 'pronounciation and to know what to improve.


2. Vizualization side or **Photo studio**. Here the user will be able to make pictures of the things around him - we all know the things in our homes, our jobs or favorite places. With taking pictures of well known things will help you to remember easier the new words.

3. Memorization side or **Laboratory** - here the user will have to explain to himself the new words. He will be able to save new words and to add his own explanations about them.
