# MyTinyEnglishApp
Little app about studying English

## What is all about

The concept of the app is to help the user with studying English in his own personal way and using the full potential of his surrounding.


Think for yourself as a user. You will have different options to study. The application will have three categories:


1. Vocalization side. It is friendly named **Recording studio** - in this part of the application you will be able to type a word that you want and to listen its correct pronounciation. The best part is that after that you will be able to record your own voice saying the word and comparing it with the app's pronounciation. That way you will be able to improve your own vocalization with time.

2. Vizualization side or **Photo studio**. Here you will be able to take pictures of the things around you - we all know the things in our home, our job or favorite places. Taking pictures of well known things will help you to remember easier the new words.

3. Memorization side or **Library**. Think of the Library as a big dictionary where you will be able to explain yourself the new words. You will be able to save new words, add your own explanations about them or delete them.
